Game: Very fragile pet

The game is you have to take care of a very fragile pet, and almost anything and everything can kill it. Not fed on time? Dead. Not played with enough? Dead. House fire caused by pet? Dead.

The game only ends when you reach a certain time without killing your pet.

There are different items in the game that do different things, heal differently, and there is a shop to buy those things.

You earn money by going to work but you have to bring your pet with you or it'll die. FYI there are things at work that can kill your pet.

Use random module to start random events where pet tries to die again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dying scenarios/other ideas:

1: Hunger level reach 0 (died of starvation even though it was fed like 5 mins ago)
2: Fun level reach 0 (Your pet was bored to death)
3: Cleanliness level reach 0 (Your pet smells so bad it's own smell suffocated itself and it died)
4: Bathroom level reach 0 (Your pets bladder exploded and it died)

When at work the fun levels decrease faster.

Types of pets:

1: Cigarette smoking mouse: Cleanliness doesn't bother mouse, but he spends your money buying cigarettes.
2: Germaphone cat: Cat will entertain itself so you don't have to play with it, but if it's cleanliness reaches 50%, not 0, it dies.
3: Clingy dog: Dog will never have cause trouble for owner (so some events will never happen ex: housefire) but dogs fun level goes down faster
4: Attention-seeking bird: More events will occur at work because your bird wants attention but bird will never need to use the bathroom because it just goes anywhere.

1: Mouse is having withdrawl symptoms! Go to the store and buy a pack of cigarettes
2: Cat got a speck of mud on it and it's cleanliness level drops down to 26%
3: You didn't pet dog and now it thinks you hate him. Fun levels drop down to 1%
4: Attention seeking bird flew into a window and now it has a concussion. Get to the vet!

n = input name (global variable)

pets are variables in a list. (global)

-------------------------

function choose pet:

    while choosing:

        choice = input "choose pet!"

        if choice in petlist:
            print description of pet
            yn = "want pet?"

            if yn == "y":
            print celebratory message
            choosing = False

            else:
            Go back to pet selection screen

        else:
            print "not an option try again"
            go back to selection screen
